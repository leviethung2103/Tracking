# Face-Detection-and-Tracking
Computer Vision model to detect face in the first frame of a video using pre-trained Viola-Jones detector and to continue tracking it in the rest of the video frames using:


1) CamShift


2) Particle Filter


3) Kalman Filter trackers.


This is implemented in OpenCV 3.3.0 and Python 2.7.
